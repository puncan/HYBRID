\section{Data Design and Control}
The data transfer in the HYBRID framework is fully standardized:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  \textbf{\textit{Modelica Models}}: API deployed by Modelica Models;
  \item \textbf{\textit{FMI/FMU}}: API deployed by the FMI/FMU importer/exporter for RAVEN and Modelica models.
\end{itemize}
The documentation of these APIs is reported in the HYBRID user manual.

\section{Human-Machine Interface Design} 
 There are no human system integration requirements associated with this software.
 \section{System Interface Design} 
HYBRID framework contains Modelica models that can be interfaced directly by modelica packages (e.g. Dymola) or
via the standardized FMI/FMU interface.

 \section{Security Structure} 
The software is accessible to the open-source community (Apache License, Version 2.0). No restrictions for downloading or redistributing is applicable.

 \section{REQUIREMENTS CROSS-REFERENCE} 
The requirements are detailed in SPC-2990, ``HYBRID Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Traceability Matrix''.
