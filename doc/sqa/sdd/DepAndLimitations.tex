\subsection{Other Design Documentation}
Also available within the repository ``Repository'' is the HYBRID Repository User manual within the “docs” folder. This user manual gives a detailed explanation of the installation process, system dependencies alongside links upon which where to find them, and an explanation of the Modelica models within the repository. 

\subsection{Dependencies and Limitations}
The software should be designed with the fewest possible constraints. 
Current constraints are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Commercial Modelica platform Dymola -- \url{https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/latest-release/}

 \item Risk Analysis and Virtual ENviroment (RAVEN) -- \url{https://raven.inl.gov/SitePages/Software%20Infrastructure.aspx}
 
 \item Python 3 -- \url{https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html}
 
 \item Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition. -- \url{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/}
 \end{enumerate}

\section{Definitions and Acronyms}

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Baseline.} A specification or product (e.g., project plan, maintenance and operations [M\&O] plan, requirements, or 
design) that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that thereafter serves as the basis for use and further 
development, and that can be changed only by using an approved change control process. [ASME NQA-1-2008 with the 
NQA-1a-2009 addenda edited]
  \item \textbf{Validation.} Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence (e.g., acceptance test), that the requirements 
for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled. [ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E) edited]
  \item \textbf{Verification.}
  \begin{itemize}
     \item The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development 
     phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.
     \item  Formal proof of program correctness (e.g., requirements, design, implementation reviews, system tests). 
     [ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E) edited]
