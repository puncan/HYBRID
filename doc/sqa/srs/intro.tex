\section{Introduction}
The HYBRID repository is a collection of models and workflows used to assess the technical and economic
feasibility of different integrated energy systems. The repository includes a library of high fidelity
Modelica models developed in Dymola that includes models of nuclear reactors, gas turbines, hydrogen
production facilities, energy storage technology, and other integrated energy system technologies. Models
have been developed since 2014 through a tri lab coordination between Idaho National Laboratory (INL),
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). With the models users can
quickly create large scale integrated energy systems to test out the technical interoperability of systems
and develop novel control strategies to best integrate systems together. In addition to the high fidelity modelica
models the HYBRID repository provides workflows that allows direct integration with the Risk Analysis Virtual
Environment (RAVEN) code developed at INL and itâ€™s plugins the Heuristic Energy Resource Optimization Network
(HERON) and the Tool for Economic AnaLysis (TEAL) packages.
