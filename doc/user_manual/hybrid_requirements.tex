\textbf{Software requirements are as follows:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Commercial Modelica platform Dymola -- \url{https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/latest-release/}.
\item Risk Analysis and Virtual ENviroment (RAVEN) -- \url{https://raven.inl.gov/SitePages/Software%20Infrastructure.aspx}
\item Python 3 -- \url{https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html}
\item Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition. -- \url{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/}
\end{enumerate}

	

\textbf{Note}: Steps 3 and 4 can be accomplished by following the RAVEN installation instructions in step two. The installation procedure will be outlined below. 
All physical models are run within the Dymola simulation framework graphical user interface (GUI).  Background information on the Modelica as a language as well as good general guidance on coding practices can be found at the two references shown below.
