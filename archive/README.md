This folder contains the archive of the 
old examples, milestones and models that have been developed in the years. 
The tests, examples and models in these folder and subfolders are not 
maintained (not updated), but they serve as records of analyses completed in the
past years.

The folder is organized in years (subfolders). In each subfolder, a README.md
file is located with, at least, the following information:
- Date and time
- SHA Commit code of the repository when the tests have been executed.  This will allow to download the snapshoot of the repository for executing the test cases.
- Type of tests: e.g. RAVEN only, RAVEN and DYMOLA, RAVEN and Modelica, DYMOLA only, etc
