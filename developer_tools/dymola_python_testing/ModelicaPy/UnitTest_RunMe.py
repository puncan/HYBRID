****************Unit Testing for ModelicaPy v1.1****************
---- This is a unit test for any Modelica Library that
---- utilizes a modified version of the BuildingsPy library.
---- This script was designed to run regression tests when
---- the resources folder is not in the same directory as
---- the top level package.mo file (the origional BuildingsPy
---- assumes Resources and top level package.mo are in the
---- same direcroty).
----
---- To run properly Dymola must be on the system path.
----
---- :param libHome: directory that contains top level package.mo
---- :param rootDir: directory that contains Resources folder.
----
---- This script assumes it is within ModelicaPy itself.
---- However, it can be modified to:
---- *Assume Buildingspy is on system path
----         -Comment out line 55
---- *Hardcode in a custom path to BuildingsPy
----         -Comment out line 55
----         -Uncomment line 57 and enter path manually
----
---- This script will run simulations, gather output, and
---- compare to existing results issuing a pass or fail.
---- If there are no stored results or results differ you
---- can accept or reject simulation results.
----
---- For more documentation on BuildingsPy please visit
---- http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/buildingspy/

    function run_unit_tests takes inputs that are the absolute path to the
    resources folder and top level package.mo
    This is important since BuildingsPy was written in a way that the resources
    folder and package.mo must be in the same directory. This script is capable
    of running unit tests on single packages. By Default it tests all .mos 
    scripts found in rootDir. Calling with one parameter will run unit tests on
    the sing package specified e.g. python our_test.py Turbine will test only 
    the Turbine.mos script.
